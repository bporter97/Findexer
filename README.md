# Findexer
Tool for locating files and returning their full file paths

The goal of this project is to provide a faster way of locating files as opposed to an OS file explorer (think windows file explorer, except not painfully slow).

Currently, this application is being developed only for windows, but eventually the application will evolve past a simple command line application for windows, and have full linux compatibility.

Further down the road, it is inteded for this project to have the option of implementing a backend that indexes files on a remote server/device along with a gui interface for a project-management like experience.

But for now. Let's keep it simple :)

<p>Usage instructions: findex [-f, -d, or -h] &lt;Directory path or file name&gt; [-f] &lt;filename&gt; </p>
