# Findexer
Tool for locating files and returning their full file paths

The goal of this project is to provide a faster way of locating files as opposed to an OS file explorer (think windows explorer, etc...).

Eventually, the application will evolve past a simple command line application and have a backend that indexes files on a remote server/device along with a gui interface.

But for now. Let's keep it simple :)

<p>Usage instructions: findex [-f, -d, or -h] Directory path or file name [-f] <filename> </p>
